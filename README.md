# Python Analysis: Gun Violence in the United States

## Background:
Gun violence has steadily increased over the last decade. So much so that doctors and public health officials have begun to call the rising number of people killed or hurt by guns in recent years an epidemic. The data is a result of incidents of violence committed with firearms, such as handguns, shotguns, or semi-automatic rifles, collected from over 7,500 law enforcement, media, government and commerical sources.
## Goal:
Perform compreshensive analysis of data relating to incidents related to gun violence to derive insights.
## Key Questions:
* What role does geographical location in gun related incidents?
* How have injuries and fatalities increased year over year?
* Does the time of year have any correlation to the number of fatalities or injuries?
* Is there a correlation between incidents of gun violence and the Federal Reserve unemployment rate?

## Process:
* Clean data
  - Remove duplicate or irrelevant observations
  - Fix structural errors
  - Filter unwanted outliers
  - Handle missing data
  - Validate data
* Explore relationships between variables
  - Correlation analysis
  - Pairplots
  - Categorical analysis
* Conduct spatial analysis of fatalies and injuries
* Perform linear regression analysis 
* Use clustering anaylsis with k-means
* Merge Federal Reserve unemployment rate with dataset
* Run time series analysis
* Create analytical dashboard in Tableau: [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/erin.swift/viz/GunViolenceinUSv1](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/erin.swift/viz/GunViolenceinUS_16941128402650/GunViolence)
